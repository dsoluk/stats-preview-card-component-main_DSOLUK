## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Lots of patience with aligning elements...not getting it yet! :->

### What I learned

Thanks to @TechNech, I was able to switchback to using Flexbox only and code is much simpler. Not sure I got desktop totally aligned but good enough

Original write up below...

Spent lots of time on CSS Grid. Should've started without as I understand older browsers do not necessarily support it. I did start with Mobile 1st approach and could've avoided Grid. But, was keen to learn it as it makes so much sense for layout. I've worked alot with spreadsheets so feel comfortable with this approach.

I'm feeling better about alignment but I'm still struggling so need to keep at it.

I tried to use srcset for the 2 different images but I'm thinking my intended functionality is not working.
